# Transcriptome
This part contains the custom code for the transcriptome data analysis and for the proteomics data analysis regarding spliceosomal proteins.

For proteomics analysis:

Splice_heatmap3.R: Differential phosphorylation of spliceosomal proteins over time.
For transcriptomics analysis:
swimming_downstram_pipeline.R: Rscript for statistic analysis of RNA-seq, especially splice variants
graphics_splice_variants.R: Visualization of splice variants
plotVolcano_transcripts.r: Visualization of p-values and fold changes of RNA-seq analysis
