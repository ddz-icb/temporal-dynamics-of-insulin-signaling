# Transcriptome
This part contains the custom code for the transcriptome data analysis as well as custom code for the proteomics data analysis regarding spliceosomal proteins.

For proteomics analysis:
1. `Splice_heatmap3.R`: Differential phosphorylation of spliceosomal proteins over time.

For transcriptomics analysis:
1. `swimming_downstram_pipeline.R`: Rscript for statistic analysis of RNA-seq, especially splice variants
2. `graphics_splice_variants.R`: Visualization of splice variants
3. `plotVolcano_transcripts.r`: Visualization of p-values and fold changes of RNA-seq analysis
