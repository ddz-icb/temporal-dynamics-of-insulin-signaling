# Temporal-dynamics-of-insulin-signaling
This repository contains the custom programming code related to the manuscript entitled "Temporal phosphoproteomics reveals circuitry of phased propagation in insulin signaling". The code consists of three parts that relate to the three data sets described in the manuscript:
- [Phosphoproteome](phosphoproteome)
- [Total proteome](total_proteome)
- [Transcriptome](transcriptome)
