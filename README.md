# Temporal-dynamics-of-insulin-signaling
This repository contains the custom programming code related to the manuscript entitled "Temporal phosphoproteomics reveals circuitry of phased propagation in insulin signaling". The code consists of three parts that relate to the three data sets described in the manuscript:
- [Phosphoproteome](phosphoproteome)
- [Total proteome](total_proteome)
- [Transcriptome](transcriptome)

## General system reqirements
### Hardware requirements
The code was tested on hardware from 2020 with an Intel Core i7 multi-core CPU and 16 GB RAM.

### Software requirements
#### Operating system requirements
- Linux: Ubuntu 16.04
