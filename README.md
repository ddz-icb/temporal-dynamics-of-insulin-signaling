The programming code of the data analyses for the manuscript "Temporal phosphoproteomics reveals circuitry of phased propagation in insulin signaling" is provided here. This consists of three parts that relate to the three data sets described in the manuscript:
- [Phosphoproteome](phosphoproteome/phosphoproteomics-description.md)
- [Total proteome](total_proteome/phosphoproteomics-description.md)
- [Transcriptome](transcriptome/transcriptome-description.md)
